# Mercator App

- It is a mobile application designed to buy, sell and donate anything in campus


# Idea Behind the App

- The idea originated when we saw a pile of previous year's books which were of no use to us. Why not give our books and other stationaries to our juniors.

# Features 

- Sell your items quickly 
- Find verified college notes and books
- Find contact details of possible buyers to negotiate your deals
- Donate your stuff

# Problems which we can solve

- Deforestation of trees for making pages of books and notebooks can be reduced. This App would encourage studnets to reuse them
